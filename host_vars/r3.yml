# The when: inventory_hostname in groups['pair_1'] guard on each pair test block

# Computed overlay IPs (rv_*_overlay_ip, rv_*_test_ip) are defined in
# roles/release_verification/vars/main.yml using rv_host_octet[inventory_hostname].
# Peer IPs are computed inline in task files as rv_host_octet[rv_peer] — no
# hostvars[] lookup needed, so no per-host stubs required here.
